# Karyotype-alteration-in-Colorectal-cancer-metastasis ![GitHub Logo](/images/Barts.jpg)

The aim of this project is to determine if there are any changes between the karyotype of primary tumours versus their matched metastatic tumours.
## Description
Cancer cells carry different types of mutations associated with cell proliferation and cell longevity. 
Certain alterations only affect one or a few base pairs. Others, known as copy number alterations (CNAs), involve larger portions of the genome that can either be deleted or gained. 
Tumours in different patients carry variable amounts of these deletions or amplifications. Genome-wide CNA profiles, or karyotypes, are in many cases characteristic of the tissue of origin. 
It is known that tumour CNA burden is a pan-cancer prognostic factor associated with recurrence and that genome doubling (GD) is associated with metastasis. 
However, it is unknown if the seeding of a primary tumour to a distant metastatic site results in specific karyotype adjustments that facilitate adaptation to the new microenvironment.
